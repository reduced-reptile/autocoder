  problemTitle: 'Problem J1: Speed fines are not fine!'
  problemDescription: |
    Many communities now have "radar" signs that tell drivers what their speed is, in the hope that
    they will slow down.
    You will output a message for a "radar" sign. The message will display information to a driver
    based on his/her speed according to the following table:
    | km/h over the limit | Fine |
    |---------------------|------|
    | 1 to 20             | $100 |
    | 21 to 30            | $270 |
    | 31 or above         | $500 |

  problemTitle: 'Problem J2: Sounds fishy!'
  problemDescription: |
    A fish-finder is a device used by anglers to find fish in a lake.
    If the fish-finder finds a fish, it will sound an alarm.
    It uses depth readings to determine whether to sound an alarm.
    For our purposes, the fish-finder will decide that a fish is swimming past if:
    * there are four consecutive depth readings which form a strictly increasing sequence (such as 3 4 7 9) (which we will call "Fish Rising"), or
    * there are four consecutive depth readings which form a strictly decreasing sequence (such as 9 6 5 2) (which we will call "Fish Diving"), or
    * there are four consecutive depth readings which are identical (which we will call "Constant Depth").
    All other readings will be considered random noise or debris, which we will call "No Fish."
    Your task is to read a sequence of depth readings and determine if the alarm will sound.

  problemTitle: 'Problem J3: Icon Scaling'
  problemDescription: |
    You have been asked to take a small icon that appears on the screen of a smart telephone and scale
    it up so it looks bigger on a regular computer screen.
    The icon will be encoded as characters (x and *) in a 3 × 3 grid as follows:
    ```
    *x*
     xx
    * *
    ```
    Write a program that accepts a positive integer scaling factor and outputs the scaled icon. A scaling
    factor of k means that each character is replaced by a k × k grid consisting only of that character.
